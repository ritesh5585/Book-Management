This project allows users to add books, view them instantly on the screen, and delete them when no longer needed. The core logic is inspired by a standard To-Do application, but adapted for managing books instead of tasks.

This project is built to practice **JavaScript fundamentals**, DOM manipulation, clean UI structure, and basic CRUD-like operations.
